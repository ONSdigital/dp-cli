dp-cli
======

Command-line client providing *handy helper tools* for the ONS Digital Publishing software engineering team

:warning: Still in active development. If you notice any bugs/issues please open a Github issue.

Getting started
---------------

Clone the code

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ONSdigital/dp-cli.git
```

:warning: `dp-cli` uses Go Modules and **must** be cloned to a location outside of your `$GOPATH`.

### Prerequisites

**Required:**

The DP CLI uses Go Modules so requires a go version of **1.11** or later.

**Optional:**

 The following are only required for some functionality of this tool.

In order to use the `dp ssh` subcommand you will need:

- [`dp-setup`](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-setup) cloned locally:

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:ONSdigital/dp-setup
  ```

In order to use the `dp import cmd` subcommand you will need:

- [`dp-code-list-scripts`](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-code-list-scripts) cloned locally:

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:ONSdigital/dp-code-list-scripts
  ```

- [`dp-hierarchy-builder`](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-hierarchy-builder) cloned locally:

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:ONSdigital/dp-hierarchy-builder
  ```

### Configuration

Configuration is defined in a YAML file. By default the CLI expects the config to be in `~/.dp-cli-config.yml`. The config file location can be customised by setting `DP_CLI_CONFIG` environment variable to your chosen path.

The [sample config file](./config/example_config.yml) should be tailored to suit you. For example:

```bash
cp -i config/example_config.yml ~/.dp-cli-config.yml
vi ~/.dp-cli-config.yml
```

### Build and run

Build, install and start the CLI:

```sh
make install
dp
```

Or to build a binary locally:

```sh
make build
./dp
```

You should be presented with a help menu similar to:

```text

### Common issues

#### Credentials error

`error creating group commands for env: develop: error fetching ec2: {"develop" "development"}: NoCredentialProviders: no valid providers in chain. Deprecated.`

[Ensure you have AWS credentials set up](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp/blob/master/guides/AWS_CREDENTIALS.md).

If you do not want to set up separate profiles, another option is to not specify any profiles in your `~/.dp-cli-config.yml`. That way the default credentials will be used.

```yaml
environments:
  - name: production
    profile:
  - name: develop
    profile:
  - name: cmd-dev
    profile:
```

#### SSH command fails

```sh
âžœ  dp ssh develop
ssh to develop
```

If the SSH command fails, ensure that the `dp remote allow` command has been run for the environment you want to SSH into.

#### Remote Allow security group error

`Error: no security groups matching environment: "develop" with name "develop - bastion"`

Ensure you have `region=eu-west-1` in your AWS configuration.

Depending on the command you're trying to run, and what you're trying to access, ensure your `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE` is set correctly.

#### Remote Allow security group rule already exists error

```sh
$ dp remote allow develop
[dp] allowing access to develop
Error: error adding rules to bastionSG: InvalidPermission.Duplicate: the specified rule "peer: X.X.X.X/32, TCP, from port: 22, to port: 22, ALLOW" already exists
        status code: 400, request id: 26a61345-8391-4c65-bfd7-4f0052892b6b
```

The error occurs when rules have previously been added and the command is run again.
Use `dp remote deny $env` to clear out existing rules and try again.

This error should no longer appear - the code should now avoid re-adding existing rules.
However, it is possible that the rule has been added with a description that does not match your username.
If so, you will have to use the AWS web UI/console to remove any offending security group rules.

### Advanced use

#### Manually configuring your IP

Optionally, (e.g. to avoid the program looking up your IP), you can use an environment variable `MY_IP` to force the IP used when running `dp remote allow`, for example:

```sh
MY_IP=192.168.11.22 dp remote allow develop
```
